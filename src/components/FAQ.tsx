  {
    question: "Do you accept insurance?",
    answer: "No, but a superbill is provided for self-submission to your insurance provider. Many clients find they can receive partial reimbursement for out-of-network therapy services. I also offer flexible payment options to make therapy accessible."
  },
  {
    question: "Are online sessions available?",
    answer: "Yesâ€”all virtual sessions are conducted via Zoom on secure, HIPAA-compliant platforms. Virtual sessions are available Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 1 PM to 5 PM. Online therapy can be just as effective as in-person sessions."
  },
  {
    question: "What is your cancellation policy?",
    answer: "I require 24-hour notice for cancellations or rescheduling. This allows me to offer the time slot to other clients who may need it. Late cancellations or no-shows may be charged the full session fee, though I understand emergencies happen."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if therapy is right for me?",
    answer: "Therapy can benefit anyone experiencing stress, anxiety, relationship difficulties, trauma, or simply wanting personal growth. If you're feeling overwhelmed, stuck, or curious about developing better coping strategies, therapy might be helpful. I offer a brief consultation to discuss your needs."
  },
  {
    question: "What should I expect in my first session?",
    answer: "Your first session is an opportunity for us to get to know each other. We'll discuss what brings you to therapy, your goals, and any concerns. I'll explain my approach and answer questions. This helps determine if we're a good fit and creates the foundation for our work together."
  },
  {
    question: "What therapy approaches do you use?",
    answer: "I use an integrative approach, drawing from cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based interventions, and trauma-informed care including EMDR. My approach is tailored to your specific needs and preferences to ensure the best possible outcomes."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does therapy typically last?",
    answer: "The length of therapy varies depending on your goals and needs. Some people benefit from short-term therapy (8-12 sessions), while others prefer longer-term support. We'll regularly check in about your progress and adjust as needed."
  },
  {
    question: "Where is your office located?",
    answer: "My office is located at 1287 Maplewood Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90026. In-person sessions are available Tuesday and Thursday from 10 AM to 6 PM. The office is easily accessible with parking available."
